The MongoDB inShare file sharing app API master is a GitHub repository that contains the backend code for building a file-sharing application using MongoDB. The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, and the MongoDB database.

The application provides RESTful APIs to handle user registration, login, file upload, and file download operations. The API also includes authorization and authentication features to ensure the security of the files being shared.

The database schema is designed to store user details and file metadata such as file name, type, size, and upload date. The API uses various middleware like multer for file upload, JWT for authentication, and mongoose for database schema management.

The repository includes all the necessary files and code for building and running the application, along with instructions for setting up and configuring the project. The application can be deployed to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible on the web.
